Run the appropriate script to execute the jar; make sure you have (at least) the JRE installed.
Capitalization of elements matters (CO is carbon monoxide, Co is cobalt) -- append subscripts as numbers following the relevant element (CO2 is carbon dioxide).
Separate reactants/products with "+" (spaces are optional).
